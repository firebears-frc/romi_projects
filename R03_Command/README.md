# Command Based Program

This is a sample Command-based Romi program. It uses naming conventions borrowed from previous [Firebears](https://github.com/firebears-frc) robots.

Note that the [RomiVendordep.json](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/romi-vendordep) delivers at least the following classes:
* `RomiMotor`
* `RomiGyro`
* `OnboardIO`
