# Romi Blink Program

This Romi program just tests the OnBoardIO.
* When you enable Teleoperated mode, the Green LED will flash.
* When you enable Autonomous mode, the Red LED will flash.
* When you enable Test mode, the Yellow LED will flash.

Note that we make use of the file `vendordeps/RomiVendordep.json` to pull in [Romi specific classes](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/romi-robot/hardware-support.html#compatible-classes).
